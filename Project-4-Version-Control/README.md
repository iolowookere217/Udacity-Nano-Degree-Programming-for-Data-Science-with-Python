Initialize a git repository

Check the status of my files to make sure they are not being tracked
Stage my changes
Commit my changes with a descriptive message.
Push my commit to my remote repository
Create a branch named documentation on my local repository.
Switch to the documentation branch. 
Switch back to the master branch. 
Create a branch named refactoring on my local repository.
