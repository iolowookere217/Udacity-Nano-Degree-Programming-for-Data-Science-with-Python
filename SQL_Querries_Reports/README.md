The Sakila Movie Database is a SQL Database of online DVD Rentals. The database was queried to answer questions about business decisions

In this project:

I Extracted Data Using SQL QUERIES and Export to CSV

I analysed the data and cleaned it using Excel

I cleaned and visualized the data to show some useful insight.

I also used pivot table to generate new and deeper insight.
